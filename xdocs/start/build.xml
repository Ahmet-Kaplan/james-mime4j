                    <p> Go to the <a

                            Sourceforge download pages</a> and download the most
                        recent release in your prefered format, either
                        <code>mime4j-x.y-src.tar.gz</code> or
                        <code>mime4j-x.y-src.zip</code>. Extracting the archived
                        sources will create the directory <code>mime4j-x.y/</code>

                        how to checkout the sources from the CVS repository. </p>
                </subsection>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Download and install Maven">
                <p> You will need to download and install <a
                    href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> before building
                    the sources. The build has been tested with version 1.0 of
                    Maven so use this or a later version if possible. </p>
                <p> One of the main differences between Maven and plain ant is
                    that Maven manages external dependencies for your projects
                    and (at least in theory) you should no longer have to store
                    third-party jar files in your CVS tree. It maintains a local
                    repository of versioned libraries and shares them between
                    your Maven projects. If it can't find the necessary files
                    there it will attempt to download them from the main Maven
                    repository at www.ibiblio.org/maven. So to use the Maven
                    build, you need to have a network connection available for
                    the inital download of the project dependencies. </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Building the mime4j jar">
                <p> Once Maven has been installed, building the project should
                    be as simple as typing <blockquote>
                        <code>cd mime4j-x.y/ (cd mime4j/ if sources come from
                            CVS)<br/>maven jar</code>
                    </blockquote> from the command line. Maven will
                    automatically run all test cases for you. If you want to
                    disable the tests you should replace the last command above
                    with <blockquote>
                        <code>maven -Dmaven.test.skip=true jar</code>
                    </blockquote> Maven will create the
                    <code>mime4j-x.y.jar</code> jar file in the
                    <code>target</code> directory. For more information on using
                    Maven, have a look at the <a
                        href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven web site</a>. </p>
