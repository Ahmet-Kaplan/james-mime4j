Release 0.4
-------------------

Mime4J is a flexible MIME parsing library written in Java. SAX, DOM and pull parsing
styles are supported.

The 0.4 release brings a number of significant improvements in terms of 
supported capabilities, flexibility and performance: 

* Revised and improved public API with support for pull parsing

* Support for parsing of 'headless' messages transmitted using non SMTP 
  transports such as HTTP

* Reduced external dependencies. Mime4j is no longer directly dependent on log4j 
  and commons-io

* Improved parsing performance (up to 10x for large messages)

* More comprehensive header parsing including support for RFC1864, RFC2045, 
  RFC2183, RFC2557 and RFC3066

* Revised packaging and exception hierarchy. MimeException now extends
  IOException.

Notes
-----
 * 0.4 contains numerous API improvements and is not binary compatible with 0.3
 * Mime4j API is still considered unstable and is likely to change in future releases
 * DOM support has known limitations and some roundtrip issues remain to be resolved
 * Some low level functions are available only in the pull parser (recommended for 
   advanced users)
