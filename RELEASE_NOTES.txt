Release 0.4
-------------------

The 0.4 release brings a number of significant improvements in terms of 
supported capabilities, flexibility and performance: 

* Revised and improved public API with support for pull parsing

* Support for parsing of 'headless' messages transmitted using non SMTP 
  transports such as HTTP

* Reduced external dependencies. Mime4j is no longer directly dependent on log4j 
  and commons-io

* Improved parsing performance (up to 10x for large messages)

Mime4j API is still considered unstable and may change in the future releases.
